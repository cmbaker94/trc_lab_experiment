Christine M Baker's respository of codes developed to process remotely sensed and in situ data collected during laboratory experiments.

## Background:
Rip currents are one of the main mechanisms which transport of contaminants, pollutants, and larvae from the the surf zone (wave breaking region) to the inner shelf (offshore edge of wave breaking to ~1.5 km offshore). Additionally, rip currents are hazardous for recreationally beach users. The spatial and temporal variability of transient rip currents, hypothesized to be generated by surfzone eddy coalescence, is poorly understood. The formation and evolution of transient rip currents were investigated with laboratory experiments using remote sensing, including visible-band cameras and LiDARs, and an array of in situ sensors. The O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory's Directional Wave Basin at Oregon State University (see image below) allowed for known offshore wave conditions incident on an alongshore uniform barred bathymetry. The lab environment was modified to enhance remotely sensed signals with biodegradable surfactant, seeding of the surf zone with tracers, and controlled diffuse lighting. The sea surface elevation was measured with in situ pressure gages, cross-shore and alongshore-scanning LiDARs, and the application of stereo processing methods to 8 Hz images from three cameras.
